# Math Quiz Challenge

This Python program presents an engaging math quiz challenge that tests your arithmetic skills by generating random addition and multiplication questions. After answering each question, the program provides immediate feedback on correctness. At the end of the quiz, your score is displayed along with encouraging remarks based on your performance.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the code.
3. Run the program using the command:
   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```
4. Answer the arithmetic questions presented.
5. Receive immediate feedback on each answer.
6. At the end of the quiz, your final score and performance remarks will be displayed.

## Functions
- `ask_question(min_num, max_num)`: Generates random arithmetic questions (addition or multiplication) and prompts the user for an answer.
  - Returns `True` if the answer is correct, `False` otherwise.

## Program Logic
1. The program generates a specified number of random addition and multiplication questions using the `ask_question()` function.
2. Users input their answers for each question.
3. Immediate feedback on the correctness of each answer is provided.
4. The final score is calculated and displayed along with performance remarks.

## Scoring and Remarks
- If you answer all questions correctly, you'll receive an "Excellent!" remark.
- If you answer no questions correctly, you'll be encouraged to "Review your math!"
- If you answer more than half of the questions correctly, you'll be told "Not bad!"
- Otherwise, you'll be encouraged with "Can do better."
