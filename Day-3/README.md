# Magic Number Guessing Game

This Python program is an interactive game that challenges players to guess a randomly generated magic number within a specified range. Players have a limited number of attempts to correctly identify the magic number. The program provides feedback after each guess to help players make informed decisions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the code.
3. Run the program using the command:
   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the magic number.
5. Receive feedback after each guess and find out if you've won or lost.

## Functions
- `ask_number(min_num, max_num)`: Prompts the player to input a number within the specified range, ensuring valid input.
- `generate_magic_number(min_num, max_num)`: Generates a random magic number within the provided range.

## Game Flow
1. The program generates a random magic number within the specified range.
2. Players are given a limited number of lives to guess the magic number.
3. Players input their guesses using the `ask_number()` function.
4. Feedback is provided after each guess, guiding players towards the correct answer.
5. The game continues until players either guess the magic number correctly or run out of lives.

## Outcome
- If players guess the magic number within the given lives, they win.
- If players exhaust all their lives without guessing correctly, they lose and the magic number is revealed.
