Magic Number Guessing Game
This Python program is a simple game that challenges you to guess a magic number within a specified range. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. The program provides feedback after each guess to help you narrow down your choices.

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x

**Getting Started**
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

**Usage**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Run the program using the command: 
   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
5. Enter your guesses and receive feedback based on whether the magic number is higher or lower.

**Functions**
- `ask_number(min_num, max_num)`: Asks the user to input a number within the specified range.
- `draw_square(size)`: Draws a square with the given size.

**Main Logic**
1. The program generates a random magic number within a predefined range.
2. It prompts the player to enter their guesses within the same range.
3. The player's remaining lives are displayed after each guess.
4. The program provides feedback to guide the player in adjusting their guesses.
5. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the magic number or runs out of lives.
