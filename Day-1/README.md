# DAY #1 

This is the README file for the code snippet labeled "DAY #1".

## Description

This code is a Python script that interacts with the user to gather and display information about their name, age, and height. It demonstrates the usage of basic input/output operations, exception handling, and conditional statements.

## Getting Started

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the code file ("main.py") is located.
4. Run the script using the command: `python main.py`

## Code Overview

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Asks the user for their name.
2. Asks the user for their age, validating that a valid numeric value is entered.
3. Asks the user for their height, validating that a valid numeric value is entered and that the height is realistic.
4. Displays the user's information along with some additional details about their age group.
5. Displays the user's height.

## Usage

1. When you run the code, it will prompt you to enter your name.
2. After entering your name, it will prompt you to enter your age. Make sure to enter a valid numeric value.
3. Next, it will ask for your height. Enter a valid numeric value for your height. If your entered height is unrealistically high (above 2.5 meters), you will be prompted to enter a valid height.
4. The code will then display your name, age, and some additional information about your age group.
5. It will also display your entered height.

## Additional Information

- The code uses a series of functions to achieve its tasks, promoting code organization and reusability.
- The input validation ensures that the user provides appropriate input, preventing crashes due to unexpected values.
- The code utilizes conditional statements to determine the age group of the user and provides relevant information based on that.
- Make sure to provide valid inputs to get accurate results.

Feel free to experiment with the code and modify it as needed for your purposes!
